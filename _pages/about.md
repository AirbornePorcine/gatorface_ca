## The Craftsperson

My journey into woodworking began with a revelation about its incredible potential for sustainability. Working with wood offers an infinite canvas for creating beautiful, useful pieces while maintaining a deep connection to environmental responsibility. The tactile nature of shaping wood by hand has become fundamental to my approach, making each project an opportunity to explore the unique characteristics of the material.

## A Sustainable Approach
{: .section-title}

At the heart of Gatorface Woodworking lies a deep commitment to environmental stewardship. Every project begins with carefully selected wood, locally sourced from Vancouver Island whenever possible to reduce transportation emissions and support our local forestry community. Other elements such as bio-based resins and repurposed metals are used when they make sense.
The finishing process relies heavily on non-toxic, environmentally friendly products that are safe for your home and our ecosystem, whenever feasable, and the least damaging products when it's not.

## The Workshop
{: .section-title}

The Nanaimo workshop runs entirely on clean energy, a testament to the commitment to reducing environmental impact. While modern tools are available, traditional hand tools and manual techniques are the preferred choice for most operations. This approach not only reduces energy consumption but creates a more intimate connection with each piece.

## A Personal Commitment
{: .section-title}

I believe that beautiful home decor shouldn't come at the cost of environmental degradation. By embracing traditional woodworking methods and sustainable practices, I create pieces that are built to last for generations while contributing to a healthier planet. Each project is a close collaboration with clients, ensuring their vision is realized in the most environmentally responsible way possible.
