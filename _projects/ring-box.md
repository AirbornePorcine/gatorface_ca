| Ebonized Red Oak, local Arbutus | Shellac, beeswax | Ebonizing was performed by immersing the wood in a mixture of vinegar and leftover steel wool.<br/>Engraving was done with a laser cutter with HEPA filter to avoid emissions.<br/>I filled the box with fabric offcuts from sewing projects as padding! |
